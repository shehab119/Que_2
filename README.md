## You have to set the allRead variable to false using a built-in higher-order function on the `notifications` array.

### Consider the following snippet:

```js
let notifications = [
        {message: ‘Lorem’, read: true},
        {message: ‘Ipsum’, read: true},
        {message: ‘Dolor’, read: true},
        {message: ‘Sit’, read: false},
        {message: ‘Amet’, read: true}
    ];

let allRead = true;
```
